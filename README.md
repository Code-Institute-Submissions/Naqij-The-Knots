## Owner Goals

* Increase the number of buyers.
* Increase rankings on search engines.


### Requirements
* Easy to navigate on various screen sizes.
* Keep the user interested with information to make them want to engage with the website.
* Simple methods of contacting the owner.
* Visually inviting so users do not leave and recommend to friends and family.


### Expectations

* I expect all navigation links to work correctly.
* I expect screen size not to affect the quality of the website.
* I expect all information to be correct and accurate.


## Design Choices

### Fonts
In order site more appealing I have used the 
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main "The Knots" I have used [Beau Rivage](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Beau+Rivage?query=mon "Beau Rivage Font") as I believe it needed to look different than the rest of the website but not too different that it starts looking weird. For the main text I have chosen [Roboto Flex](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Flex?query=mon "Roboto Flex Font") as I feel it has a sharp, simple and easy to read look. To make the headers stand out form the text, I decided to use [Roboto Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed?query=rob "Roboto Condensed Font") and to make the Navigation bar stand out I decided to use [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=rob "Roboto Font").

### Icons
I have used icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons will only be used where there is no explination is and are really common among the users like social media links, hamburger for navigational links on smaller devices.


# Wireframes
I have used Photoshop to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially created the desktop version first and then scalled it down for tablet and smart phones. Because a requirement is to give little but quality information to the user to make them want to engage with the site. I have used a one-page website. This gets the user through the content and quickly via scrolling or directly clicking the navigation bar.


# Features

## Existing Features

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is fully responsive to allow for various screen sizes. It includes links to manover around the site easily. The site logo which is clickable to go link back to the home page.

+ Desktop (>=950px)

    In order for the user to visably see which of the links they are hovering over there is a rectangular border around the text.

    + Small devices max (<600px)

    - As the navigation bar would be unuseable in the desktop version on smaller devices, it takes on a hamburger style.

    When the hamburger icon is clicked it will slide in the nav bar below the website logo.
